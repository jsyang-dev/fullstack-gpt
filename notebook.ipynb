       "AIMessage(content='Victory Mansions is a dilapidated and run-down apartment building where Winston resides in the novel \"1984\" by George Orwell. The building is in poor condition with cramped living spaces and minimal amenities. It has a hallway that smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats, with a colored poster of an enormous face with the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.\" The flat is located seven flights up and accessed by stairs due to the unreliable lift. The building is under constant surveillance with a telescreen that cannot be completely shut off. From its roof, one can see all four Ministries of Oceania simultaneously. The layout of the flat is unusual, with the telescreen placed on the longer wall opposite the window, and an alcove that allows Winston to be heard but not seen.')"
